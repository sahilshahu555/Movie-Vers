## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Movie App locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is used as the backend database to manage and store information about movies.

- Express.js: A server-side web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs. The Express.js framework is utilized to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and interact with the MongoDB database.

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components. The front-end of this project is built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. In this project, Node.js is used as the server-side runtime environment to execute server-side logic, handle requests, and serve the React application.

These technologies, collectively known as the MERN stack, enable a full-stack JavaScript development environment, providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in building modern web applications.
